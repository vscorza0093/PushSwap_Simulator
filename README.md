<h1> PushSwap_Simulator </h1>

* This project was made as a tool to visualize push_swap project from école 42.

* The goal is to sort random numbers in ascending order into stack_a with the minimum possible number of operations. 

* To do this you have the following operations at your disposal: 

>
*sa : swap a - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack_a.
*sb : swap b - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack_b.
*ss : sa and sb at the same time. 
*pa : push a - take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. Do nothing if b is empty.
*pb : push b - take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. Do nothing if a is empty. 
*ra : rotate a - shift up all elements of stack_a by 1. The first element becomes the last one. 
*rb : rotate b - shift up all elements of stack_b by 1. The first element becomes the last one. 
*rr : ra and rb at the same time. 
*rra : reverse rotate a - shift down all elements of stack_a by 1. The last element becomes the first one.  
*rrb : reverse rotate b - shift down all elements of stack_b by 1. The last element becomes the first one. 
*rrr : rra and rrb at the same time.
